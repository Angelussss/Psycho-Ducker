# Psycho Ducker

Welcome to the Psycho Ducker, a 75% exploded keyboard project! This is a hot-swappable, compact, and efficient keyboard. Below, you'll find all the details you need to build and understand this project.

## Layout

The keyboard features a 75% exploded layout, offering a balance between functionality and compactness. The exploded design separates key clusters for a modern aesthetic and improved usability.

## Components

### Essentials

-   **MCU:** STM32F072CBT6.
    
-   **Switches:** Cherry MX style (supports both 3-pin and 5-pin switches).
    
-   **Keycaps:** Standard keycap set compatible with the Cherry MX stem.
    
-   **Diodes:** SOD-123.
    
-   **Hot-swap sockets:** Kailh are recommended.
    

### Optionals

-   **M2 screws** (to secure the PCB to the case or standoffs).
    
-   **M2 standoffs** (for added stability between the PCB and case).
    
-   **Stabilizers** (PCB-mounted, required for larger keys like the spacebar, enter, and shift).
    

## Required Tools

-   **Soldering iron**: Required for soldering pretty much the whole project.

- **heatgun**: Heavily hinted for soldering the micro. with a basic soldering iron is very hard.
    
-   **USB cable**: Required for connecting the keyboard to your computer. The PCB uses a usb type-C connector. Be sure to have at least one usable!
    

## Assembly Requirements

To assemble this keyboard, you'll need medium tin soldering skills, particularly for the micro.

## Notes

-   This keyboard's PCB is designed for hot-swapping switches, making possible to change the switches without de-soldering and re-soldering.
    
-   Firmware is powered by [QMK](https://qmk.fm/), a powerful and customizable open-source keyboard firmware.
    
-   This design has been tested thoroughly and functions reliably. However, as with any DIY project, minor adjustments may be needed based on your specific components.
    
-   Feel free to use this design for personal projects, but please do not edit or misuse it.
    
-in this design there are several types of cases you might wanna use. you can find the different materials and files in the "case" folder. The case is not necessary and is hands down the hardest part as it uses specific and expensive machinery,
